# Hit It

Hit It is an app designed to help independent musicians plan and organize their tours. A user (band/musician) can sign in with their email and password. They will land on their profile page which features their band information and a list of their tours (past, present, and furture) and they also have the ability to create new tours. Within those tours, users are able to add, edit, or delete shows and show information. On the venue page, users are able to search for venues based on location and filter those venues based on venue type. This page features a map with icons indicating individual venues. The icons are clickable and feature a pop up which gives some venue information. On the bands page, users can search for bands based on location and can be directed to that band's profile page to find more information about the band. Finally, the calls page allows users to 'make a call', or advertise that they need help booking a show in a given location. Alternately, it also allows users to view calls in their location that they may want to respond to.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Run 'npm install' in the project directory
3. Clone the backend repo to your machine and follow those instructions
4. Ensure that you have succesfully started the Rails server
5. Run 'npm start'

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
